This is a sample iOS app to get Image of The Day from NASA api

This is an iOS app for iPhone in Portrait orientation.

Improvements
1. Loader can be used when fetching data to UI, to give better UX to user
2. I was framing unit test cased to follow TDD approach, means first to fail test cases and then correct the code and then pass the test case ,so due to time constraint not fully finished.
3. UI test cases may be added for snapshot testing
4. Detail view can be added to show the completed description to user
5. Can add functionality for pinch and zoom when image is shown to user.
6. We can add more features like
        1. To save all past images
        2. Can show all saved images to Collection view to user
        3. We can add like/unlike facility to make profiles for user
